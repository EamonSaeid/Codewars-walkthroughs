# Codewars-walkthroughs
Hi all!

As a student of Python, I find working on challenges from codewars is really beneficial for my learning. I enjoy building small projects to test my skills, but the main piece of feedback for me that I have been successful is that the code runs as itended. Watching my code finally run after hours of attempting different solutions brings me immense satisfaction, but theres never really any motivation to question if there is a better solution. As the saying goes, if it isn't broken, don't fix it. 

After doing a few codewars challenges, I was quickly humbled by the fact my solutions weren't nearly as elegant as some of the top answers. Looking at some of the best answers identified areas where I had written loops where a function was available, or where I came up with wacky or wild solutions to things that really didn't require it. After a few more challenges, I realised my solutions were getting better, but alot of knowledge was falling through the cracks and not getting implemented as I would have hoped. To combat this, I have been writing up my solutions as I come up with them, and then after submitting my answer, I write a review to the top solutions, to act as reinforcement of the lessons I learn from them and to act as a reference when I inevitably become stuck again in the future.

I hope these notebooks can be beneficial to other learners - I have written them in such a way that you may begin to understand my approach to problems and problem solving.

If you notice any errors in my notes or have anything to share which may be beneficial, please reach out to me through linkedin at https://www.linkedin.com/in/eamon-saeid-295188166/.
